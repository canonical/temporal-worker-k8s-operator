  environment:
    description: |
      This configuration is used to manage and retrieve sensitive information required 
      by the application from different sources. The `environment` configuration supports 
      the following sources:
      
      - **Environment Variables**: Plaintext environment variables.
      - **Juju**: Secrets can be managed and retrieved using Juju's secret storage capabilities.
      - **Vault**: Secrets can be securely stored and accessed from a HashiCorp Vault instance.
      
      The application will prioritize these sources in the following order: Vault, Juju, 
      and then environment variables. If a variable is not found in the higher priority 
      sources, it will fallback to the next available source. This ensures that the 
      application can function correctly in various deployment scenarios while maintaining 
      security and flexibility.

      Sample structure:
    
        ```yaml
          env:
            - name: key1
              value: value1
            - name: nested_example_key
              value: 
                - connection_id: a_connection_id
                  unnesting:
                    tables:
                      issues: ["test1", "test2"]
                      users: [test3]
                  redaction:
          juju:
            - secret-id: <secret_id1>
              name: sensitive1
              key: key1
            - secret-id: <secret_id1>
              name: sensitive2
              key: key2
            - secret-id: <secret_id2> # reads all keys from this secret
          vault:
            - path: my-secrets
              name: sensitive1
              key: key1
